# Introduction
For my first portfolio project I wanted to develop a website where users can find out more about Mindfulness following Project Example Idea 3. The main goal is to inform users about the benefits of Mindfulness are and provide examples of techniques to practice Mindfulness in one's everyday life.  

There is also a page where users can sign up and subscribe to the newsletter or decide to subscribe to a premium plan and get access to mindfulness content like guided meditations and other useful tips. 

# Project Overview
## Structure
Mindfully is a 4 page website with each having its own navigation link at the top of the page. The Home page is the default loading page. Users can easily navigate to other pages via the navigation links and buttons.


## Existing Features


## Future Implementations
- Add a new page for a test/challenge (as a form, with radios or checkboxes) to spark curiosity in the users and invite them to integrate mindfulness tips in their lifestyle.
- Create a page for each technique and link it them to each technique image in the gallery. I would also add a dropdown menu for the technique page listing all techniques so that users can learn more about each technique.
- Create another page for virtual events and meetups.

## Design 
### Colour Palette
When I started thinking about the design of the website, I immediately pictured it would have some green in it as this colour conveys peace and calm. I later had the chance to read that some psychological studies have proved green to be soothing, with antidepressant properties: my choice was made. I chose images with warm colors to match the calming/soothing styles.
The shade of green chosen in particolar is HEX #A8C082 (RGB	168	192	130). 
The navbar and header are styled accordingly, as well as all the buttons. I chose the color #a8c082 while designing the logo on Canva, that I later imported to be displayed in the header across all webpages.

## Wireframes
The design of this website was first conceived using wireframes in Balsamiq. This helped me follow my original idea throughout the developing process. While some slight differences might be noticed between the wireframes here below and the final product, the basic structure and featured have been kept in mind during the process and are more or less the same as the original idea.

# Testing
## Known Bugs/Issues
- Benefits page
![bug-1](/assets/images/Bug-1.png)

- Text not centered in form
![bug-2](/assets/images/Bug-2.png)

- Space before "Pillars" section
![bug-3](/assets/images/Bug-3.png)
## Resolved Bugs
- "Join us" remains underlined when not selected (in Plans page)
![bug-4](/assets/images/bug-4.png)
How it was fixed:
Since the basic html structured was copied from the "Join us" page, I checked the menu bar code first. In effect, class="active" was still within the "Join us" tag instead of the actual page "Plans". Copied and pasted class="active" to "Plans" tag.
