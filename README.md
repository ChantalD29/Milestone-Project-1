# Introduction
For my first portfolio project I wanted to develop a website where users can find out more about Mindfulness following Project Example Idea 3. The main goal is to inform users about the benefits of Mindfulness are and provide examples of techniques to practice Mindfulness in one's everyday life.  

There is also a page where users can sign up and subscribe to the newsletter or decide to subscribe to a premium plan and get access to mindfulness content like guided meditations and other useful tips. 

# Project Overview
## Structure
Mindfully is a 4 page website with each having its own navigation link at the top of the page. The Home page is the default loading page. Users can easily navigate to other pages via the navigation links and buttons.


## Existing Features


## Future Implementations
- Add a new page for a test/challenge (as a form, with radios or checkboxes) to spark curiosity in the users and invite them to integrate mindfulness tips in their lifestyle.
- Create a page for each technique and link it them to each technique image in the gallery. I would also add a dropdown menu for the technique page listing all techniques so that users can learn more about each technique.
- Create another page for virtual events and meetups. 



# User Experience (UX)
# User Experience (UX)
Key information about the site for users: 
* What is Mindfulness?
* What are the benefits?
* Techniques and practice overview.
* Premium plans available to start practice it with Mindfully.
* Newsletter signup to keep posted about Mindfully. 

As a user, I want to:
* Find out about mindfulness
* Know the basics of mind techniques
* Be able to subscribe to a premium plan, or the newsletter 

As a developer, I want the site to:
* Be displayed clearly on different devices
* Be estetically appealing to spark interest in the user
* Be easy to navigate and provide helpful information
* Encourage users to subscribe to the free trial and eventually subscribe to a premium plan


## User Stories
- **Mark** is new to mindfulness. After a difficult period and some health issues, he has finally recovered and his doctor suggested he give mindfulness a try to live a helthier and less rushed lifestyle. His daugthers google the keyword "mindfulness" and "health" and run into Mindfully, where they can all find usedul information and start the free trial period.
- **Hillary** had practiced yoga and pilates almost everyday for a couple of years a while ago. Her life became a lot busier over the past few years...she regrets not practicing yoga or pilates anymore, and she's willing to take on a new challenge: she wants to be more mindful of her habits and decides to learn more about mindfulness.
- **Chris**  has always been into mindfulness and meditation: it is just the perfect way to manage her anxiety. He is used to reading about mindfulness and watching useful content on YouTube from his favorite channels. He is now browsing for free trials over the internet and decide on which service to subscribe. 

## Design 
### Colour Palette
When I started thinking about the design of the website, I immediately pictured it would have some green in it as this colour conveys peace and calm. I later had the chance to read that some psychological studies have proved green to be soothing, with antidepressant properties: my choice was made. I chose images with warm colors to match the calming/soothing styles.
The shade of green chosen in particolar is HEX #A8C082 (RGB	168	192	130). 
The navbar and header are styled accordingly, as well as all the buttons. I chose the color #a8c082 while designing the logo on Canva, that I later imported to be displayed in the header across all webpages.

## Wireframes
The design of this website was first conceived using wireframes in Balsamiq. This helped me follow my original idea throughout the developing process. While some slight differences might be noticed between the wireframes here below and the final product, the basic structure and featured have been kept in mind during the process and are more or less the same as the original idea.

# Testing
##  Bugs
- Benefits page
![bug-1](/assets/images/Bug-1.png)
How it was fixed:
The issue here was in the header, since it had no height value and it ended up encroaching the h2. That's why the two overlapped. By targeting the header and adding some volume, I was then able to center the h2 as wished.

- "Join us" remains underlined when not selected (in Plans page)
![bug-4](/assets/images/bug-4.png)
How it was fixed:
Since the basic html structured was copied from the "Join us" page, I checked the menu bar code first. In effect, class="active" was still within the "Join us" tag instead of the actual page "Plans". Copied and pasted class="active" to "Plans" tag. 

- Text not centered in form
![bug-2](/assets/images/bug-button.png)
How it was fixed:
Thanks to the Dev Tool I was able to identify the problem in display:block and changed to display:inline.
